# MyFizzBuzz
A fun project on good coding


### I was inspired by Tom Scott after watching his video, found [here](https://youtu.be/QPZ0pIK_wsc)

The video goes over why the FizzBuzz game is a good way to evaluate proper coding etiquette

The base rules of the game are simple:
  - take a range of numbers
  - When the number is divisible by 3, in stead of saying the number, say 'Fizz'
  - When the number is divisible by 5, in stead of saying the number, say 'Buzz'
  - If the number is neither divisible by 3 or 5, say the actual number.

***All code was independely written by me. It was fun***

***Thank you Tim Scott for the inspiration, and to you, Reader, for being here.
